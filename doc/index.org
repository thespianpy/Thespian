Thespian is a Python library providing a framework for developing
concurrent, distributed, fault tolerant applications.

Thespian is built on the [[http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model][Actor Model]] which allows applications to be
written as a group of independently executing but cooperating "Actors"
which communicate via messages.  These Actors run within the Actor
System provided by the Thespian library.

  * Concurrent :: All Actors run independently within the Actor
                  System.  The Actor System may run the Actors as
                  threads, processes, or even sequential operations
                  within the current process---all with no change to
                  the Actors themselves.

  * Distributed :: Actors run independently...anywhere.  Multiple
                   servers can each be running Thespian and an Actor
                   can be run on any of these systems---all with no
                   change to the Actors themselves.  Thespian handles
                   the communication between the Actors and the
                   management process of distributing the Actors
                   across the systems.

  * Location Independent :: Because Actors run independently anywhere,
       they run independently of their actual location.  A distributed
       Actor application may have part of it running on a local
       server, part running on a server in Amsterdam, and part running
       on a server in Singapore... or not, with no change or awareness
       of this by the Actors themselves.

  * Fault Tolerant :: Individual Actors can fail and be
                      restarted---automatically---without impact to
                      the rest of the system.

  * Scalable :: The number of Actors in the system can be dynamically
                extended based on factors such as work volume, and
                systems added to the Distributed Actor System
                environment are automatically utilized.

One of the key aspects of the Actor Model is that it represents a
higher level of abstraction than is provided by most frameworks.  When
writing an Actor-based application, the concurrency and transport
layers are completely abstracted, which both simplifies the design and
allows the concurrency or transport to be changed in the future
/without/ requiring changes in the Actor-based application.

The above qualities of Actor programming make it ideally suited for
Cloud-based applications as well, where compute nodes are added and
removed from the environment dynamically.

* Quick Start

** Simple Installation

Install the Thespian library on your local host system using pip:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ pip install thespian
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Starting a Thespian Instance

Start a default Thespian Actor System on the current host system:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ python
>>> from thespian.actors import *
>>> ActorSystem("multiprocTCPBase")
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Hello World

A Hello World example:

#+NAME: helloActor.py
#+BEGIN_SRC python -n
from thespian.actors import *

class Hello(Actor):
    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        self.send(sender, 'Hello, World!')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello = ActorSystem().createActor(Hello)
    print(ActorSystem().ask(hello, 'hi', 1))
    ActorSystem().tell(hello, ActorExitRequest())
#+END_SRC

The above will create an Actor, send it a message and get a "Hello
World" response, and then tell that Actor to exit because it is no
longer needed.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ python helloActor.py
Hello, World!
$
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Hello World Redux

It's easy to extend the Hello World example to include multiple actors
which communicate with each other.  This example shows a number of
additional details:
  * the messages exchanged between the Actors can be anything that can
    be pickled.
  * Actors can create other Actors dynamically
  * Actor Addresses can be passed around
  * Actors remain until they are removed by sending them an
    ~ActorExitRequest()~

#+NAME: helloActor2.py
#+BEGIN_SRC python -n
from thespian.actors import *

import sys

class Greeting(object):
    def __init__(self, msg):
        self.message = msg
    def __str__(self): return self.message

class Hello(Actor):
    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        if message == 'hi':
            greeting = Greeting('Hello')
            world = self.createActor(World)
            punct = self.createActor(Punctuate)
            greeting.sendTo = [punct, sender]
            self.send(world, greeting)

class World(Actor):
    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        if isinstance(message, Greeting):
            message.message = message.message + ", World"
            nextTo = message.sendTo.pop(0)
            self.send(nextTo, message)

class Punctuate(Actor):
    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        if isinstance(message, Greeting):
            message.message = message.message + "!"
            nextTo = message.sendTo.pop(0)
            self.send(nextTo, message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello = ActorSystem().createActor(Hello)
    print(ActorSystem().ask(hello, 'hi', 0.2))
    print(ActorSystem().ask(hello, 'hi', 0.2))
    ActorSystem().tell(hello, ActorExitRequest())
    print(ActorSystem().ask(hello, 'hi', 0.2))
#+END_SRC

Running above will create an Actor and send it a message.  That Actor
will create two other Actors, passing the message along to the first
which then passes it to the second before finally sending the message
back to the original requestor.

The original requestor is code outside of the Actor environment.  This
external requestor uses the ~ask()~ API call which assigns it an Actor
Address just like any other Actor.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ python helloActor.py
Hello, World!
$
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is just a quick introduction to getting started with Thespian.
