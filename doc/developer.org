    Thespian documentation is maintained in the source tree under the
    ~doc/~ directory.  Documentation is written in Emacs orgmode,
    which allows export as PDF, HTML, text, and other formats.

    HTML output uses the ~htmlize~ package for syntax coloring, and
    the ~bigblow~ theme from Fabrice Niessen at
    https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes.

    Documentation should be generated using the ~doc/gen_html.sh~ or
    ~doc/gen_pdf.sh~ bash script and specifying the source file for
    the document to be generated; the results are generated in the
    same ~doc/~ directory.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ bash doc/gen_html.sh doc/using.org

    Contributions (both source and documentation) should be in the
    form of pull requests.  Contributions will not be accepted until
    the contributor has agreed to the contributor's agreement.
    Thespian uses the [[https://cla-assistant.io][cla-assistant.io]] which will automatically check
    to see if a contributor has click-signed the contributor's
    agreement; as a contributor you will automatically be given a link
    to sign the agreement when you make your contribution.

* Testing

** Approach
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hH-1c7bb213-1e22-455e-b767-c9a6a1a5cd68
   :END:

  While there are some Thespian tests that use mocking to reduce the
  effects of external elements, the main focus of Thespian testing is
  *functional* testing to make sure that the ActorSystem is providing
  proper functionality for the Actors that will be running.  Writing
  mock'ed unit tests for Thespian is still a welcome contribution, we
  have just focused our primary efforts on the functional tests.

  This functional approach means that the tests will actually create
  threads or processes (depending on the systembase) and that all
  systembases are tested on the same set of tests.

** Test Duration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hH-f099ef66-5ab1-45d7-a700-b065f885ca75
   :END:

  Because of the approach above running the tests can take some time.
  Test can even can hang if there is bad code or if system resources
  become exhausted (e.g. no more sockets available), and there can be
  spurious effects from the real world (e.g. timing failures if the
  local system is excessively busy).

  Every effort is made to have tests run quickly and reliably, but
  validating functionality is the most important goal.

  As of Thespian 3.7.0, the full test suite duration is approximately
  1500 seconds.

** Testing System Bases
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hH-1dfd22a5-0c88-4d8e-8e0d-5383a503678a
   :END:

  Because all systembases are tested, it is necessary to accomodate
  the differences between those system bases.  For most Actors, there
  should be no difference between systembases and they should be
  unaware of which one is running, but it is not practical for all
  systembases to support all features; the administrator starting the
  ActorSystem is responsible for starting a system appropriate to the
  task and Actors at hand.

  Some of the system bases do not support some features (as detailed
  [[http://thespianpy.com/doc/using.html#hH-2a5fa63d-e6eb-43b9-bea8-47223b27544e][here in the Using Thespian guide]]) and so there are inputs provided
  to the tests to indicate which are viable and/or stable.  More on
  this in the Running Tests section below.

** Running Tests
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hH-a992a85a-623f-47c8-a810-deefcb82a521
   :END:

  Tests are written to fairly conventional Python unittest standards
  without relying on plugins.  Tests are normally run via the pytest
  package (run via ~$ py.test~), and the latter provides various
  testing controls.

  For simple, direct runs of specific tests, direct nose invocation of
  those tests is usually sufficient:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ py.test thespian/test/testSimpleActor.py::TestASimpleSystem
#+END_EXAMPLE

  As discussed above, all system bases are tested (by default) so the
  ~simpleSystemBase~ is usually covered by the ~TestASimpleSystem~
  testcase so that it is tested before any of the more complex system
  bases (due to alphabetically appearing first).

  The viability and focus of individual testcases is specified using
  methods from the ~thespian/test/__init__.py~ file:

  * unstable_test ::

     Specifies that the test is unstable for the specified base and
     should be skipped. The features tested may usually work, but are
     not reliably supported by the underlying base (e.g. the UDP
     transport does not provide delivery guarantees, so hi-traffic
     tests are marked with ~unstable_test("multiprocUDPBase")~

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     unstable_test(asys, basename[, ...])
     #+END_EXAMPLE

  * actor_system_unsupported ::

     Specifies that the functionality being tested is not supported by
     this particular system base and the test should be skipped for
     the indicated base(s).

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     actor_system_unsupported(asys, basename [,...])
     #+END_EXAMPLE


  When running the tests from the command line, the normal
  pytest-based commands can be used, with optional attribute
  specifiers to identify tests, categories ("Func" or "Unit"), and
  system bases.  For example, to run all unit tests:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ py.test -k Unit
#+END_EXAMPLE

The above is saved in ~scripts/run_unit_tests.sh~ for convenient
re-use.  In addition, the ~scripts/run_main_functional_tests.sh~ file
contains the following specification which is used to run all the
stable functional tests for the standard set of testbases:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ py.test -k Func
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Writing Tests
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hH-bf031295-256d-471e-922a-808a77c3fbec
   :END:

When writing tests for Thespian, there is an ~asys~ fixture for pytest
that provides an initialized ActorSystem for each system base.
Writing the test to accept ~asys~ as a parameter will cause pytest to
run the test once for each system base type.
