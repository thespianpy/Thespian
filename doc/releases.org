Thespian uses [[http://semver.org][Semantic Versioning]]: "major.minor.bugfix", where major
version changes indicate incompatible changes, minor versions indicate
added functionality that is backwards compatible, and bugfix changes
do not change the API.


* 2.x

** 2.5

*** 2.5.10 <2016-05-03 Mon>

**** API and Public Changes

  * Added a Websocket Actor example and the Actorize decorator
    contributed code from Paul Jimenez.

  * Added ThespianWatch and WatchMessage functionality.

**** Behavioral Fixes

  * Update logging if convention leadership is changed for logging via
    new leader.

  * Restart the logger if it exits.

  * Update signal handling to better interrupt wait cycles in
    transports, resulting in handling signals more immediately.

  * Ensure actor checks/restarts caused by updating Actor System
    capabilities only affect actors on the updated system.

  * Fixed bug on address forwarding that caused transmit lockups when
    the forwarded message exceeded the pending transmit limit.


**** Internal Bugfixes

  * Update the logging to use a global transport instance to ensure
    that children inheriting threads will use the proper transport
    instance.

  * Add small wait to allow child exit information to propagate and be
    handled.

  * Update the admin for handling child exit signalling to provide
    better detection of children that are no longer running.

  * Miscellaneous test updates to ensure distinct Actor Systems used
    for different tests to avoid crosstalk failures.

  * Better handling of closed/bad file descriptors in the
    multiprocTCPBase transport to handle remote closures, etc.

  * Use a thread-safe Queue in the async transports to ensure that
    transmits queued by alternate threads (e.g. log messages) only
    enter the core transport work loop via the main thread.

  * TCP transport cleanups from Paul Jimenez.

  * Fixed wakeup transport handling for TransmitOnly mode.


*** 2.5.9 <2016-03-21 Mon>

  * Fix signal handling introduced in 2.5.8 release to support Windows
    and other operating systems that don't define the full set of
    standard Unix signals.

*** 2.5.8 <2016-03-21 Mon>

  * Added protection to prevent simpleSystemBase internal addresses
    from being killed ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/5][Issue #5]]).

  * Updated documentation to clarify the status, availability, and
    intended usage of ActorSystemMessage messages ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/6][Issue #6]]).

  * Updated documentation to describe the potential for Message
    Mutability for some ActorSystem bases as a tradeoff for
    performance ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/7][Issue #7]]).

  * Added internal atexit and signal handling functionality to attempt
    normal Actor shutdown (via ~ActorExitRequest~ message delivery) in all
    circumstances.

  * Added internal SIGCHLD signal handling to send ~ChildActorExited~
    messages to parent Actors in cases where the child process was
    unable to send that message before exiting.

  * Updated documentation to clarify which ActorSystem Capabilities
    are read-only (for each system base).

  * Modified internal loaded source hash tagging for better handling
    of circular import references in loaded sources.


*** 2.5.7 <2016-03-14 Mon>

  * Updated loaded source lookup failure to throw ImportError
    exception instead of BadZipFile exception for compatibility with
    importing code handling the former.

*** 2.5.6 <2016-02-11 Thu>

  * Fixes for detection of socket closure in the TCPTransport:
    corrected errno reference and add handling of additional errors
    (for Windows and Mac OS/X).

  * Update TCPTransport to ensure select() is never called with empty
    select lists (needed for Windows).

  * Added small delay in ActorSystem shutdown to allow
    shutdown-related communications to complete.

  * Update source loading tests to allow Source Authority registration
    before commencing test.

  * Selection of "temp" directory for writing logs adjusted to be
    OS-aware.

  * Added logging for actor instantiation failures (normal logging in
    addition to previously-existing internal logging).

  * Updated default logging for thespian tests to support Windows
    which cannot inherit an open logging file descriptor in forked
    children.

*** 2.5.5 <2016-02-05 Fri>

  * Added fix for closing open TCPTransport sockets to a remote Admin
    that is known to be unavailable (i.e. on explicit or time-based
    de-registration).

  * Ensure that all sends are routed through the local admin if the
    local environment is TX-Only ("Outbound Only": True capability)
    for TCPTransport-based communications.

*** 2.5.4 <2016-02-01 Mon>

  * Calling ~loadSource()~ multiple times for the same source does
    nothing instead of unloading and reloading the source.  This
    provides more consistent behavior, especially when working with
    objects instantiated from the original source.

  * Fixed possible scenario where logging of errors from TCP transport
    would encounter further problems.

  * Test updates.

*** 2.5.3 <2016-01-28 Thu>

  * Fixed hash representation of TCP routed and tx-only addresses to
    provide consistent hash values and match the equality-sense of the
    addresses.

  * Better convention management, especially for pre-registered members.

  * Minor update to ActorAddress string representation for TCP routed
    addresses.


*** 2.5.2 <2016-01-13 Wed>

  * Enhanced and fixed logging messages, including severity indications.

  * Formatting updates in the design document.

  * Update allowable multi-system actor response times in tests.

  * Limit status key/value output column alignment width to 40 characters.

  * Added TCPTransport idle sockets to status reports.

  * Fix multiple TCPTransport transmit retry handling and re-queueing bugs.

  * Enhance TCPTransport to gracefully handle receive of a remote
    message while waiting for an ACK of a locally transmitted message.

  * Update TCPTransport for full address/target re-evaluation on
    message forwarding to properly handle dead targets and related
    scenarios.

  * Immediate cancel of all pending transmits to a remote target on
    Connection Refused (remote target is dead).

  * Fixed TCPTransport to never use a negative delay (occurs if
    pending wait time on an event has already expired) and use a zero
    delay instead.

  * No socket-level timeout on connects from TCPTransport; timeout management
    is done internally to TCPTransport.

  * Allow connection to Admin even if the reported address is
    different than the expected address.  This allows support for
    systems that change addresses or which have multiple viable
    addresses.

*** 2.5.1 <2015-12-16 Wed>

  * Fixed sourceload path handling: zipfiles use posix paths only, but
    running loaded sources on Windows with previous versions attempted
    to use Windows path specifications.

  * Increased level of logging from sourceload failures to ERROR from
    INFO.

*** 2.5.0 <2015-12-16 Wed>

  * Allow value specification with the ~@requireCapability~ decorator.

  * Add the ~preRegisterRemoteSystem~ and ~deRegisterRemoteSystem~
    Actor API methods.  These assist in identifying remote Actor
    Systems that might not normally have connectivity.  These are most
    useful with the 'Outbound Only' capability (see below).

  * Updated the TCP system base to persist and re-use open socket
    connections; previous versions would always close the socket after
    sending or recieving a single message.  This change can increase
    network efficiency and reduce latency.  This change is backward
    compatible with previous Thespian 2.x versions and will devolve
    into the older disconnecting-mode of operation.

  * Added ~"Admin Routing": True~ capability specification (TCP system
    base only).  The presence of this capability indicates that all
    traffic routed to any Actor on that Actor System must be forwarded
    via the Admin on that Actor System (Thespian handles the
    forwarding automatically when this capability is set).  This
    configuration is useful when two Actor Systems are separated by
    firewalls that only allow a limited set of ports to communicate
    through the firewall; setting the Admin port to one of the
    firewall-allowed ports and setting the "Admin Routing" capability
    will route all traffic via the Admin (at a small performance
    penalty).  Enabling this setting is /not/ backward compatible with
    previous Thespian 2.x versions.  This setting should be considered
    /Beta/ functionality at this time.

  * Added ~"Outbound Only": True~ capability specification (TCP system
    base only).  The presence of this capability indicates that the
    current system cannot accept incoming connections.  This setting
    implies ~"Admin Routing": True~ for this same system.  This
    setting causes all Actor traffic to be routed through the Admin,
    and the Admin will open and leave open persistent connections to
    all remote Admins.  This setting is useful where a firewall or VPN
    configuration will only allow outbound connections, but it incurs
    additional performance penalties and potential delays while an
    outbound connection is being re-established.  Enabling this
    setting is /not/ backward compatible with previous Thespian 2.x
    versions.  This setting should be considered /Beta/ functionality
    at this time.

  * The "Thespian ActorSystem Version" for the TCP system base has
    been updated to "2" from "1" to indicate the above changes.

  * All systems that have attempted to create an Actor will be
    remembered to avoid infinited creation loops.

  * Logging updates and enhancements.

  * Enhance shutdown by ensuring the exiting status is set before
    shutting down children to handle their responses appropriately and
    avoid race conditions.

  * Show statistics values before labels in the status output for
    better readability.

  * Design document updates.

  * The simple system base now properly implements the ~wakeupAfter()~
    delays.  It will not hang if only wakeups are pending, but it will
    deliver them after at least the appropriate delay and relative to
    ~tell()~, ~ask()~ and ~listen()~ timeouts.

  * All ~loadActorSource()~ calls are ignored if there is no
    registered Source Authority.  This changes the disposition of an
    Actor System to secure/protected by default.

** 2.4

*** 2.4.4 <2015-12-16 Wed>

  * Removed TCP connect timeout that overrode non-blocking mode.

  * Fixed TCP address equality comparison when zero port specification
    compared.  A port of zero matches any other port if the address
    portion is the same; previously this only worked for comparing to
    known local addresses, not arbitrary addresses when the port
    was 0.

  * Fixed error text when using ~tell()~ with a bad Actor Address
    (previously identified the wrong call).

  * Ensure Actor System ~createActor()~ calls are not aborted
    prematurely by leftover responses to previous operations
    (e.g. timeout-unclaimed ~ask()~ responses).

*** 2.4.3 <2015-11-18 Wed>

  * Ensured that PoisonMessage sending doesn't recurse indefinitely.

  * Added a missing newline in status output formatting.

  * Added a descriptive failure output messaging for IP-based address
    connection failures.  This helps with common mistakes, such as
    specifying the "Admin Port" as a string instead of an integer.

  * Fixed a bug where calling ~ActorSystem().shutdown()~ multiple
    times would throw an exception.

  * Fixed a bug on multi-level import references (e.g. ~import x.y.z~)
    in sources loaded by ~loadActorSource()~ operations.

  * Fixed a bug where old actors checking in with a restarted
    ActorSystem caused exceptions.

  * Fixed a TCP transport bug that caused transmits to be abandoned
    instead of being retried after the back-off timer expired.

  * Updated default thespian.log logfile creation to honor ~$TMPDIR~ if
    it is set and only default to directing logging to ~/tmp~ if it is
    not set.

  * Added internal ~wait()~ call for logger child process on shutdown
    to avoid defunct loggers.

  * Removed a debug printf in the simpleSystemBase.

*** 2.4.2 <2015-10-26 Mon>

  * Delay thesplog location determination until usage to allow startup
    code to adjust location.

  * Better daemonization of multiproc Admin on Unix.

  * Ensure filenums to close is passed as a list not a Python3
    iterator when creating multiproc children (bugfix).

*** 2.4.1 <2015-10-20 Mon>

  * Updated to allow packets not blocked on waiting for an address
    resolution to be sent even if previous packets are still waiting
    for that resolution.

  * Fixed documentation uploads.

*** 2.4.0 <2015-10-18 Sun>

  * Add loadActorSource() and unloadActorSource() to Actor API
    (duplicating existing Actor System API functionality).

  * Internal: use distributed importlib whenever possible.

  * Fix stats response for Actor Systems for Python3.

  * Allow optional error strings in reporting actor creation failures.

  * Better capture and reporting of loaded source instantiation errors.

  * Miscellaneous test and logging updates.


** 2.3
*** 2.3.0 <2015-10-04 Sun>

  * Added ActorTypeDispatcher enhanced base class to facilitate
    dispatching of received messages based on message type.

  * Ensure exceptions occuring while writing to Thespian file log do
    not cause failures.

  * Protect against exceptions occurring when comparing messages for
    equality.

  * Updates to testActorSystemRestart.

  * Update "Thespian Generation" common Capabilities to version (2,3).
    Previous 2.2.0 release erroneously did not update this value.


** 2.2
*** 2.2.0 <2015-09-27 Sun>

  * Fix internal links in Using Thespian document.

  * Add support for multiple convention notification registrations.

  * Allow ActorSystem logDefs to be specified as False to suppress any
    logging configuration; especially useful for test log capture
    modes.

  * Better ActorSystem startup processing to distinguish between a
    re-specification of the current base and a new base, and added the
    transientUnique startup argument to get a plain instance (a
    non-global-singleton instance).

  * Added missing description of the ActorSystem ~shutdown()~
    operation in the Using Thespian document.

  * Added ability to set the maximum thesplog logging file via the
    ~THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE~ environment variable and changed the default
    to 50KB.

  * Added Using Thespian documentation description of logging with the
    ~THESPLOG_FILE~ and ~THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE~ environment variable
    controls.


** 2.1
*** 2.1.6 <2015-09-27 Sun>

  * Fix imports in tests and actors.py for multiple Python versions.

  * Add missing timeout to test to prevent hang.

*** 2.1.5 <2015-09-20 Sun>

  * Adds support for Python 3.3 and Python 3.4 versions, including the
    use of the PyPy interpreter.

  * Adds the ~listen()~ API call (~ask()~ is ~tell()~ + ~listen()~)

  * Log Actor exception through normal logging channels as well as via
    Thespian internal logging output.

  * The Thespian shell loads the TestActor via loadable sources.

  * The simpleSystemBase will always apply default logging.

  * The ~loadActorSource()~ call can now take a file-like object as
    well as a filename.

  * Added the Thespian Developer's document.

  * Added the Thespian In-Depth Introduction document.

  * Added the Thespian Index (main pages) document.

  * Added the Thespian Releases document.

  * Internal updates to more gracefully handle shutdown scenarios and
    avoid impossible retransmits.

  * Testing, documentation, and setup file updates.
