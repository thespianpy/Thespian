.

* 2.x

** 2.5

*** 2.5.0 <2015-11-19 Thu>

  * Allow value specification with the ~@requireCapability~ decorator.

  * Add the ~preRegisterRemoteSystem~ and ~deRegisterRemoteSystem~
    Actor API methods.

** 2.4

*** 2.4.4 <2015-12-16 Wed>

  * Removed TCP connect timeout that overrode non-blocking mode.

  * Fixed TCP address equality comparison when zero port specification
    compared.  A port of zero matches any other port if the address
    portion is the same; previously this only worked for comparing to
    known local addresses, not arbitrary addresses when the port
    was 0.

  * Fixed error text when using ~tell()~ with a bad Actor Address
    (previously identified the wrong call).

  * Ensure Actor System ~createActor()~ calls are not aborted
    prematurely by leftover responses to previous operations
    (e.g. timeout-unclaimed ~ask()~ responses).

*** 2.4.3 <2015-11-18 Wed>

  * Ensured that PoisonMessage sending doesn't recurse indefinitely.

  * Added a missing newline in status output formatting.

  * Added a descriptive failure output messaging for IP-based address
    connection failures.  This helps with common mistakes, such as
    specifying the "Admin Port" as a string instead of an integer.

  * Fixed a bug where calling ~ActorSystem().shutdown()~ multiple
    times would throw an exception.

  * Fixed a bug on multi-level import references (e.g. ~import x.y.z~)
    in sources loaded by ~loadActorSource()~ operations.

  * Fixed a bug where old actors checking in with a restarted
    ActorSystem caused exceptions.

  * Fixed a TCP transport bug that caused transmits to be abandoned
    instead of being retried after the back-off timer expired.

  * Updated default thespian.log logfile creation to honor ~$TMPDIR~ if
    it is set and only default to directing logging to ~/tmp~ if it is
    not set.

  * Added internal ~wait()~ call for logger child process on shutdown
    to avoid defunct loggers.

  * Removed a debug printf in the simpleSystemBase.

*** 2.4.2 <2015-10-26 Mon>

  * Delay thesplog location determination until usage to allow startup
    code to adjust location.

  * Better daemonization of multiproc Admin on Unix.

  * Ensure filenums to close is passed as a list not a Python3
    iterator when creating multiproc children (bugfix).

*** 2.4.1 <2015-10-20 Mon>

  * Updated to allow packets not blocked on waiting for an address
    resolution to be sent even if previous packets are still waiting
    for that resolution.

  * Fixed documentation uploads.

*** 2.4.0 <2015-10-18 Sun>

  * Add loadActorSource() and unloadActorSource() to Actor API
    (duplicating existing Actor System API functionality).

  * Internal: use distributed importlib whenever possible.

  * Fix stats response for Actor Systems for Python3.

  * Allow optional error strings in reporting actor creation failures.

  * Better capture and reporting of loaded source instantiation errors.

  * Miscellaneous test and logging updates.


** 2.3
*** 2.3.0 <2015-10-04 Sun>

  * Added ActorTypeDispatcher enhanced base class to facilitate
    dispatching of received messages based on message type.

  * Ensure exceptions occuring while writing to Thespian file log do
    not cause failures.

  * Protect against exceptions occurring when comparing messages for
    equality.

  * Updates to testActorSystemRestart.

  * Update "Thespian Generation" common Capabilities to version (2,3).
    Previous 2.2.0 release erroneously did not update this value.


** 2.2
*** 2.2.0 <2015-09-27 Sun>

  * Fix internal links in Using Thespian document.

  * Add support for multiple convention notification registrations.

  * Allow ActorSystem logDefs to be specified as False to suppress any
    logging configuration; especially useful for test log capture
    modes.

  * Better ActorSystem startup processing to distinguish between a
    re-specification of the current base and a new base, and added the
    transientUnique startup argument to get a plain instance (a
    non-global-singleton instance).

  * Added missing description of the ActorSystem ~shutdown()~
    operation in the Using Thespian document.

  * Added ability to set the maximum thesplog logging file via the
    ~THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE~ environment variable and changed the default
    to 50KB.

  * Added Using Thespian documentation description of logging with the
    ~THESPLOG_FILE~ and ~THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE~ environment variable
    controls.


** 2.1
*** 2.1.6 <2015-09-27 Sun>

  * Fix imports in tests and actors.py for multiple Python versions.

  * Add missing timeout to test to prevent hang.

*** 2.1.5 <2015-09-20 Sun>

  * Adds support for Python 3.3 and Python 3.4 versions, including the
    use of the PyPy interpreter.

  * Adds the ~listen()~ API call (~ask()~ is ~tell()~ + ~listen()~)

  * Log Actor exception through normal logging channels as well as via
    Thespian internal logging output.

  * The Thespian shell loads the TestActor via loadable sources.

  * The simpleSystemBase will always apply default logging.

  * The ~loadActorSource()~ call can now take a file-like object as
    well as a filename.

  * Added the Thespian Developer's document.

  * Added the Thespian In-Depth Introduction document.

  * Added the Thespian Index (main pages) document.

  * Added the Thespian Releases document.

  * Internal updates to more gracefully handle shutdown scenarios and
    avoid impossible retransmits.

  * Testing, documentation, and setup file updates.

  Thespian.  It includes the following features:

    * System Bases: SimpleSystemBase, MultiprocTCPBase, MultiprocUDPBase, MultiprocQueueBase
    * Support for Loadable Sources
