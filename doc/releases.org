Thespian uses [[http://semver.org][Semantic Versioning]]: "major.minor.bugfix", where major
version changes indicate incompatible changes, minor versions indicate
added functionality that is backwards compatible, and bugfix changes
do not change the API.

* 3.x

** 3.6

*** 3.6.0 <2017-01-02 Mon>

  * Enhancements

    * Added the thespian director to help manage loading and managing
      sources.  See the ~thespian/director.py~ file for more
      information, or ~$ python -m thespian.director~ for cli help.

    * Added ~thespian.transient~ import with ~@transient~ and
      ~@transient_idle~ decorators.  See ~thespian/transient.py~ for
      more information.

    * Added the rsasig.py helper source (used by the director) to
      perform signature validation of sources on systems where a full
      encryption/SSL library may not be installed or available.

    * Internal improvements to the ExpirationTimer and ExpiryTimer
      implementation to reduce overhead for better performance (thanks
      to Daniel Mitterdorfer).

    * A Source Authority can now actively reject a loaded source by
      responding with a None value for the validated results.
      Previously the Source Authority could only passively reject the
      source by doing nothing, which did not provide feedback to
      waiting elements about the disposition of the load attempt.

    * When displaying Actor Addresses, the final value is shown (if
      known); previously these always output as "LocalAddr" even if
      the final address was known.

    * Added a failure reason to the InvalidActorSpecification exception.

    * More logging on Actor System startup and shutdown.

    * Transports that may re-use addresses (e.g. TCP ports) do not
      need to declare an Actor Address as permanently dead-lettered in
      case of re-use.

  * Bugs

    * Ensure that loaded source information specified by an Actor is preserved.

    * Fixed a bug introduced in version 3.5.0 where the string form of
      Actor Addresses for remote actors might not show the remote
      address portion.

    * Ensure dead target transmit failures are forwarded to the dead
      letter handler.

    * Clarified that only ~.py~ files in the loadable sources are
      used, and that ~.pyo~ and ~.pyc~ files are ignored.  This has
      always been the way it operated, but the previous documentation
      stated the inverse.

  * Other

    * Miscellaneous internal cleanup.

    * Update status reporting of pending wakeups.

    * Refactor and improve simpleSystemBase handling of wakeups.


** 3.5

*** 3.5.2 <2016-12-12 Mon>

  * Slow down hysteresis backoff rate for inter-system admin messages.

  * Updates to asynchronous transmit management for better
    multi-threading support, and addition of Spin/Promela models for
    validation of this behavior.

*** 3.5.1 <2016-12-08 Thu>

  * Rollback of Admin routing address creation optimization: loses
    important information needed when passing the address to remote
    convention members.

  * Ensure local Admin always receives packets, even under high
    backlog conditions where normal actors will enter TX only mode to
    drain the outbound message queues.


*** 3.5.0 <2016-12-04 Sun>

  * Enhancements

    * Signal handling is re-enabled after being disabled in 3.0.0 with
      a new approach to avoid conflicts with signal processing
      context.

    * Only passes class name and not entire class module heirarchy to
      setproctitle for setting the Actor process name.

    * Added ability to query the troupe leader for status (intended
      for user interpretation with thespianShell and not programmatic
      consumption).

    * Added ~self.actorSystemShutdown()~ to allow an actor to shutdown
      the entire local actor system ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/24][Issue 24]]).

  * Bug Fixes and internal changes

    * The TCPTransport will attempt to close old idle sockets if it
      fails to create new sockets (incoming or outbound) due to
      resource limits.

    * Added exception protection against closed descriptors in
      TCPTransport idle socket cleanup.

    * Now closes all open idle sockets when spawning a child process
      with the TCPTransport instead of just a subset.

    * Remove child liveness detection confirmation delay (enabled
      SIGCHLD handling makes this unnecessary).

    * Ensure convention Hysteresis is reset on pre-registration of
      remote and slow down hysteresis rate.

    * Added status indication of exiting condition in status reports.

    * Internal cleanup of routed address definitions.

    * Updated visual form of addresses for more brevity.  Note that
      all code should treat Actor Addresses as opaque, and there
      should be no programmatic dependence on a specific
      representation, so this update does not constitute a
      compatibility change relative to previous versions.

    * Added optimization of AdminRouting: local targets are sent
      directly instead of routing via the Admin, and also avoid extra
      hops in routing from the Admin back to itself.

    * Upgraded logging of transmit completion errors to ERROR from
      INFO.

    * Set the TZ environment variable on startup if not already set to
      avoid repeated stat() calls to "/etc/localtime" under Unix.

    * Fixes and updates to the troupe implementation to handle
      ChildActorExit messages from workers, ensure completed work
      messages are sent back to the troupe leader, and use string
      class names for compatibility with loaded sources.

    * Use SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE on Windows to probe for existing
      multiprocTCPBase.

** 3.4

*** 3.4.0 <2016-11-07 Mon>

  * Added ~notifyOnSourceAvailability()~ call for an Actor to register
    to receive ~LoadedSource~ objects indicating that a new source
    file has been loaded and is ready to be used, and ~UnloadedSource~
    objects when a source has been unloaded.  This can be used to
    write a "source manager" that can take specific actions when these
    trigger messages indicate changes in the loaded sources for the
    current actor system.

  * Updated Actor System ~ask()~ and ~listen()~ calls to return as
    soon as a response is available.  Previously the calls did not
    return until the delay period had expired.

  * Updated convention management with a full analysis of different
    scenarios (in the design-routing document) and corresponding
    tests, with updates to the convention management code as revealed
    by these tests.  This fixes various behaviors, including an issue
    introduced in the previous release that would prevent a TxOnly
    admin from updating remote nodes and therefore causing the remote
    to enter a partially-disconnected state after about 22 minutes.
    These changes introduce significant stability and behavior
    imprlements for conventions.

  * Add ~.details~ to ~PoisonMessage~ for additional information
    ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/22][Issue 22]]).

  * Adds supported Actor Troupe functionality ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/2][Issue 2]]).

  * Fixed logging error ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/23][Issue 23]]) introduced in 3.3.0.

  * Updated packaging to include documentation and top-level files
    including the readme, license, and contributor's agreement ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/25][Issue
    25]]).

  * Internal cleanups and re-arrangement, including introduction of a
    more efficient internal timer.

  * Update TCP transport to use more efficient timer, handle socket
    shutdown corner cases (e.g. no socket created yet or already
    removed).


** 3.3

*** 3.3.0 <2016-09-15 Thu>

  * Allow ~deRegisterRemoteSystem()~ to be called with the remote
    admin ~ActorAddress~ object (as would be provided via convention
    notification) as an alternative to the raw remote address format.

  * Enhanced the thespianShell "ask" command to pretty-print the
    responses (if possible).

  * Thespian is now compatible with Python 3.6
    * Removed the "universal newline" loaded source open flag that is
      no longer supported for ~ZipFile.open()~ in Python 3.6.
    * Updated tests to account for address information now included in
      default ~str~ forms of objects.

  * Internal improvements in convention support for more reliable
    convention membership and notification.

    * When a remote pre-registration is performed, there is no
      notification until the convention attendee completes the
      checkin.

    * Better matching of loopback addresses with the "external"
      address(es) of the current system to recognize this system.

    * Better connection establishment for pre-registered remote
      convention members with local tx-only admin routing.

    * Allow more communication with remote convention members on
      shutdown for a faster and more complete cleanup and exit.

  * Internal improvements and bugfixes in the TCP transmit.

    * Enable TCP transport retransmits if ack/nak packet is corrupted.

    * Avoid non-progress select() scenarios that could result in
      periods of high CPU utilization.

    * Better handling of cleanup operations when shutting down.

  * Fixed handling for a race condition on timeout in the UDP transport.

** 3.2

*** 3.2.2 <2016-09-15 Thu>

  * Suppressed notification of pre-registered remotes on
    ~preRegisterRemoteSystem()~ call; notification is now only
    delivered when the remote actually confirms convention
    registration.

  * Fixed convention notification remote admin address value (in some
    scenarios this delivered the convention message itself rather than
    the remote address).

  * Enhanced notification tests.

  * Actors with multiple threads that initiate large numbers of sends
    from the alternate threads but which do not receive many messages
    to invoke the main thread encountered significant backlog or flow
    suppression in those threads.  This release modifies the transmit
    logic to be invokeable by any thread (but only one thread at a
    time) to avoid this situation.  The message receiving and
    invocation of the actor's ~receiveMessage()~ method still occurs
    only on the primary thread.  No change in Actor implementation is
    indicated, and this should generally improve the functionality of
    any multi-threaded Actors.

    Note that the use of Thespian Actors suggests that Actors rather
    than threads should be used for parallelism; this support is
    designed for Actors which import libraries where those libraries
    internally create multiple threads (e.g. kazoo).

  * Modified recent async transport base changes to ensure that the
    maximum number of message sends are performed at any point in
    time.  The previous release introduced a degradation wherein a
    single send could block the processing of other, independent
    message sends for a period of time; messages were still delivered
    but often not in a timely manner.

  * Enhanced the thespianShell utility's simple source authority to
    propagate available ~sourceInfo~ field for loadable sources.

  * Fixed a missing import error when resolving race conditions where
    multiple globalName actor requests resulted in multiple actors
    being created.

  * Minimized traceback line-number offsets in loaded sources from an
    offset of 3 to an offset of 1 line number.

  * Documentation updates, including a warning about the inability to
    exchange objects between different loaded sources unless
    conventionally serialized (see [[file:using.org::*Source Loading Issues][Source Loading Issues]]).


*** 3.2.1 <2016-09-08 Thu>

  * Added backward compatibility support for interacting with
    pre-3.2.0 Thespian instances without the sourceInfo argument.


*** 3.2.0 <2016-09-08 Thu>

  * Added sourceInfo argument to ValidateSource; allows informational
    tag to be associated with a loadable source for logging and status
    information.  Thespian will automatically attempt to identify the
    filename for the ~ActorSystem.loadSource()~ operation and provide
    that on status requests.

  * Updated handling for multithreaded Actors to allow any thread to
    ~self.send()~ messages (or generate logging output); receiving
    messages still occurs only on the main thread.


** 3.1

*** 3.1.1 <2016-09-08 Thu>

  * Better TCPTransport handling of connection attempts.

  * Added missing import for exception case in async transport base.

  * Explicit disable of ActorAddress hashing.

  * Updated message for ~ActorSystem.tell()~ bad target address
    exception failure.

*** 3.1.0 <2016-08-29 Mon>

  * API and Public Changes

    * Adds the ability to allow specification of a "Process Startup
      Method" capability when starting Actor Systems to select the
      process creation technique for new Actors: "spawn", "fork", or
      "forkserver".

    * Updates the thespianShell.py utility to add Python3
      compatibility and a simple Source Authority for accepting test
      actor loadable sources.

  * Behavioral Fixes

    * Actors which create multiple internal threads are now supported.
      Thespian will still create Actors as separate processes if using
      a "multiproc..."  system base, but if those Actors internal
      create threads (directly or through the use of a library), those
      threads will no longer cause failures or deadlocks when calling
      ~self.send()~ or ~logging~.

    * Adds a small timeout period for TCP transport outbound connection
      initiation to accomodate busy or noisy networks.

    * Fixes a system shutdown completion failure management bug that
      formerly caused some Actors to never receive shutdown requests.

    * Adds timeouts to MultiprocessQueueBase transmits (matching
      functionality of the multiprocTCPBase and multiprocUDPBase) to
      avoid indefinite hangs on errors or blocks.

  * Internal Bugfixes

    * Ensures that source unloaded notifications are not reciprocally
      sent between actor systems that would result in indefinitely
      repeated notifications.

    * Sets an upper limit on individual socket receive calls in the
      TCP transport to prevent starvation.  This is only a limit in
      individual receives; the overall packet size can be larger than
      the recieve and it will be reconstructed on the receiving side.

    * Retries more frequently in the TCP transport if waiting on an
      outbound transmit slot.

    * If the TCP transport encounters a connection reset while sending
      an ACK, this event is simply logged instead of throwing an
      exception.

    * Various test updates for parameterizing the various allowed time
      durations during the test.

    * Miscellaneous internal formatting and code cleanup.


** 3.0

*** 3.0.4 <2016-08-12 Fri>

  * Fix for initialization hardening in previous release.

  * Optimize ~__import__~ interceptor to avoid repeated lookup failures.

  * Extended actor creation startup allowance period to accomodate
    remote fetch of large sources.

*** 3.0.3 <2016-08-11 Thu>

  * Hardened initialization for environments where the fqdn, hostname,
    or dns lookup could cause gaierror exceptions.

  * Fixed error reporting for actor creation failure exception.

  * Internal code cleanup/enhancements and minor test updates.


*** 3.0.2 <2016-07-29 Fri>

  * More updates to tests for timing issues and adding idempotency of
    assert statements because pytest may re-execute them.

  * An Actor call to createActor may specify a sourceHash that it does
    not have the source for; fixed to properly handle this case to
    defer the createActor to the Admin and remove the erroneous error
    log output.

  * Only hook ~__import__~ for Python3.5 source loading; do not
    replicate all builtins.

*** 3.0.1 <2016-07-26 Tue>

  * Internal updates to tests for selection of available network ports
    for each test's admin address.

  * Added test delay function for convenient centralization and
    standardizationof testing delays and the ability to override,
    mock, or adjust the delay as needed.

  * Updated ~mark.skip~ specifications for broader pytest compatibility.

  * On loaded source unload, skip None (in-progress) entries in
    ~sys.modules~.

  * Optimize source load import intercept; only one definition per
    sourceload module is needed instead of per file.

  * Updated thespian shell to handle non-hashable Actor Addresses.

  * More information reported in Pending Actor timeout exceptions.


*** 3.0.0 <2016-07-04 Mon>

  * Actor Addresses are not hashable.  Previously they were
    incorrectly marked as hashable, but they may be updated internally
    over time, and this internal mutability makes them non-hashable.
    This does not affect the ability to compare addresses for equality
    and inequality.

  * Converted to using pytest for test framework; more information is
    available in the ~thespian/test/00README.txt~ file.  These changes
    include significant test updates and enhancements, as well as
    broader coverage of all current system bases and configurations
    (e.g. Admin Routing and TX Only base settings).

  * Documentation updates, including distinguishing this Thespian
    against unrelated efforts with overlapping similarities.

  * Updated sourceloading support to handle uses of ~__import__~
    directly (e,g. for sqlalchemy support).

  * Better handling of socket accept failures in the TCP transport.

  * Fixed ChildActorExited messages for unresolved local addresses to
    no longer be fatal issue.

  * Updated Convention pre-registration to properly identify as a
    pre-registration and to send a Convention De-Register for
    pre-registered systems on system shutdown.

  * Sending an ACK or NACK in the TCP transport is no longer capable
    of causing a hang in the transport on blocking sends or errors.

  * Updated the common Capabilities definitions for the
    simpleSystemBase to match the other system bases.

  * More regular throwing of exceptions for
    ~ActorSystem().createActor()~ requests for top level actors that
    cannot be satisifed.

  * Asynchronous transports will immediately fail transmit requests if
    the outbound queue has reached an upper-limit threshold in size.

  * If in transmit-only mode, fail expired requests appropriately.

  * Fix wakeup-supporting transports to always check for expired
    wakeups and immediately-processable events even if there is no
    positive non-zero time duration for transport processing.

  * Revert signal handling introduced in version 2.5.8: internal
    Python issues (e.g. http://bugs.python.org/issues14976) made the
    initial approach buggy.  Newly engineered signals support will be
    added in a forthcoming release.

  * Updated Convention Notification handler removal for common code to
    ensure the same treatment is given for all cases of handler removal.

* 2.x

** 2.6

*** 2.6.1 <2016-05-20 Fri>

  * Fix simpleSystemBase wrapping of DeadEnvelope for dead letter
    re-routing.

  * Fix SIGUSR1 status output for Windows, which has no SIGUSR1 (and
    therefore does not support this functionality).

*** 2.6.0 <2016-05-18 Wed>

  * Functional Changes

    * Added status output to thesplog on SIGUSR1 to an Actor.  This is
      useful for scenarios where the Actor is not responding to
      regular queries (e.g. network queue blockages, etc.).

  * Behavioral Fixes

    * The simpleSystemBase now properly supports system capability
      updates and validates the actorSystemCapabilityCheck results
      when creating Actors.

    * The httpserver example is fixed for handling requests with no
      QUERY_STRING portion.

    * Do not try to restart the logger if the system is being
      shutdown.

  * Internal Bugfixes

    * Many tests update to use independent admin ports to avoid
      inter-test influences.

** 2.5

*** 2.5.10 <2016-05-03 Mon>

  * API and Public Changes

    * Added a Websocket Actor example and the Actorize decorator
      contributed code from Paul Jimenez.

    * Added ThespianWatch and WatchMessage functionality.

  * Behavioral Fixes

    * Update logging if convention leadership is changed for logging via
      new leader.

    * Restart the logger if it exits.

    * Update signal handling to better interrupt wait cycles in
      transports, resulting in handling signals more immediately.

    * Ensure actor checks/restarts caused by updating Actor System
      capabilities only affect actors on the updated system.

    * Fixed bug on address forwarding that caused transmit lockups when
      the forwarded message exceeded the pending transmit limit.


  * Internal Bugfixes

    * Update the logging to use a global transport instance to ensure
      that children inheriting threads will use the proper transport
      instance.

    * Add small wait to allow child exit information to propagate and be
      handled.

    * Update the admin for handling child exit signalling to provide
      better detection of children that are no longer running.

    * Miscellaneous test updates to ensure distinct Actor Systems used
      for different tests to avoid crosstalk failures.

    * Better handling of closed/bad file descriptors in the
      multiprocTCPBase transport to handle remote closures, etc.

    * Use a thread-safe Queue in the async transports to ensure that
      transmits queued by alternate threads (e.g. log messages) only
      enter the core transport work loop via the main thread.

    * TCP transport cleanups from Paul Jimenez.

    * Fixed wakeup transport handling for TransmitOnly mode.


*** 2.5.9 <2016-03-21 Mon>

  * Fix signal handling introduced in 2.5.8 release to support Windows
    and other operating systems that don't define the full set of
    standard Unix signals.

*** 2.5.8 <2016-03-21 Mon>

  * Added protection to prevent simpleSystemBase internal addresses
    from being killed ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/5][Issue #5]]).

  * Updated documentation to clarify the status, availability, and
    intended usage of ActorSystemMessage messages ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/6][Issue #6]]).

  * Updated documentation to describe the potential for Message
    Mutability for some ActorSystem bases as a tradeoff for
    performance ([[https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian/issues/7][Issue #7]]).

  * Added internal atexit and signal handling functionality to attempt
    normal Actor shutdown (via ~ActorExitRequest~ message delivery) in all
    circumstances.

  * Added internal SIGCHLD signal handling to send ~ChildActorExited~
    messages to parent Actors in cases where the child process was
    unable to send that message before exiting.

  * Updated documentation to clarify which ActorSystem Capabilities
    are read-only (for each system base).

  * Modified internal loaded source hash tagging for better handling
    of circular import references in loaded sources.


*** 2.5.7 <2016-03-14 Mon>

  * Updated loaded source lookup failure to throw ImportError
    exception instead of BadZipFile exception for compatibility with
    importing code handling the former.

*** 2.5.6 <2016-02-11 Thu>

  * Fixes for detection of socket closure in the TCPTransport:
    corrected errno reference and add handling of additional errors
    (for Windows and Mac OS/X).

  * Update TCPTransport to ensure select() is never called with empty
    select lists (needed for Windows).

  * Added small delay in ActorSystem shutdown to allow
    shutdown-related communications to complete.

  * Update source loading tests to allow Source Authority registration
    before commencing test.

  * Selection of "temp" directory for writing logs adjusted to be
    OS-aware.

  * Added logging for actor instantiation failures (normal logging in
    addition to previously-existing internal logging).

  * Updated default logging for thespian tests to support Windows
    which cannot inherit an open logging file descriptor in forked
    children.

*** 2.5.5 <2016-02-05 Fri>

  * Added fix for closing open TCPTransport sockets to a remote Admin
    that is known to be unavailable (i.e. on explicit or time-based
    de-registration).

  * Ensure that all sends are routed through the local admin if the
    local environment is TX-Only ("Outbound Only": True capability)
    for TCPTransport-based communications.

*** 2.5.4 <2016-02-01 Mon>

  * Calling ~loadSource()~ multiple times for the same source does
    nothing instead of unloading and reloading the source.  This
    provides more consistent behavior, especially when working with
    objects instantiated from the original source.

  * Fixed possible scenario where logging of errors from TCP transport
    would encounter further problems.

  * Test updates.

*** 2.5.3 <2016-01-28 Thu>

  * Fixed hash representation of TCP routed and tx-only addresses to
    provide consistent hash values and match the equality-sense of the
    addresses.

  * Better convention management, especially for pre-registered members.

  * Minor update to ActorAddress string representation for TCP routed
    addresses.


*** 2.5.2 <2016-01-13 Wed>

  * Enhanced and fixed logging messages, including severity indications.

  * Formatting updates in the design document.

  * Update allowable multi-system actor response times in tests.

  * Limit status key/value output column alignment width to 40 characters.

  * Added TCPTransport idle sockets to status reports.

  * Fix multiple TCPTransport transmit retry handling and re-queueing bugs.

  * Enhance TCPTransport to gracefully handle receive of a remote
    message while waiting for an ACK of a locally transmitted message.

  * Update TCPTransport for full address/target re-evaluation on
    message forwarding to properly handle dead targets and related
    scenarios.

  * Immediate cancel of all pending transmits to a remote target on
    Connection Refused (remote target is dead).

  * Fixed TCPTransport to never use a negative delay (occurs if
    pending wait time on an event has already expired) and use a zero
    delay instead.

  * No socket-level timeout on connects from TCPTransport; timeout management
    is done internally to TCPTransport.

  * Allow connection to Admin even if the reported address is
    different than the expected address.  This allows support for
    systems that change addresses or which have multiple viable
    addresses.

*** 2.5.1 <2015-12-16 Wed>

  * Fixed sourceload path handling: zipfiles use posix paths only, but
    running loaded sources on Windows with previous versions attempted
    to use Windows path specifications.

  * Increased level of logging from sourceload failures to ERROR from
    INFO.

*** 2.5.0 <2015-12-16 Wed>

  * Allow value specification with the ~@requireCapability~ decorator.

  * Add the ~preRegisterRemoteSystem~ and ~deRegisterRemoteSystem~
    Actor API methods.  These assist in identifying remote Actor
    Systems that might not normally have connectivity.  These are most
    useful with the 'Outbound Only' capability (see below).

  * Updated the TCP system base to persist and re-use open socket
    connections; previous versions would always close the socket after
    sending or recieving a single message.  This change can increase
    network efficiency and reduce latency.  This change is backward
    compatible with previous Thespian 2.x versions and will devolve
    into the older disconnecting-mode of operation.

  * Added ~"Admin Routing": True~ capability specification (TCP system
    base only).  The presence of this capability indicates that all
    traffic routed to any Actor on that Actor System must be forwarded
    via the Admin on that Actor System (Thespian handles the
    forwarding automatically when this capability is set).  This
    configuration is useful when two Actor Systems are separated by
    firewalls that only allow a limited set of ports to communicate
    through the firewall; setting the Admin port to one of the
    firewall-allowed ports and setting the "Admin Routing" capability
    will route all traffic via the Admin (at a small performance
    penalty).  Enabling this setting is /not/ backward compatible with
    previous Thespian 2.x versions.  This setting should be considered
    /Beta/ functionality at this time.

  * Added ~"Outbound Only": True~ capability specification (TCP system
    base only).  The presence of this capability indicates that the
    current system cannot accept incoming connections.  This setting
    implies ~"Admin Routing": True~ for this same system.  This
    setting causes all Actor traffic to be routed through the Admin,
    and the Admin will open and leave open persistent connections to
    all remote Admins.  This setting is useful where a firewall or VPN
    configuration will only allow outbound connections, but it incurs
    additional performance penalties and potential delays while an
    outbound connection is being re-established.  Enabling this
    setting is /not/ backward compatible with previous Thespian 2.x
    versions.  This setting should be considered /Beta/ functionality
    at this time.

  * The "Thespian ActorSystem Version" for the TCP system base has
    been updated to "2" from "1" to indicate the above changes.

  * All systems that have attempted to create an Actor will be
    remembered to avoid infinited creation loops.

  * Logging updates and enhancements.

  * Enhance shutdown by ensuring the exiting status is set before
    shutting down children to handle their responses appropriately and
    avoid race conditions.

  * Show statistics values before labels in the status output for
    better readability.

  * Design document updates.

  * The simple system base now properly implements the ~wakeupAfter()~
    delays.  It will not hang if only wakeups are pending, but it will
    deliver them after at least the appropriate delay and relative to
    ~tell()~, ~ask()~ and ~listen()~ timeouts.

  * All ~loadActorSource()~ calls are ignored if there is no
    registered Source Authority.  This changes the disposition of an
    Actor System to secure/protected by default.

** 2.4

*** 2.4.4 <2015-12-16 Wed>

  * Removed TCP connect timeout that overrode non-blocking mode.

  * Fixed TCP address equality comparison when zero port specification
    compared.  A port of zero matches any other port if the address
    portion is the same; previously this only worked for comparing to
    known local addresses, not arbitrary addresses when the port
    was 0.

  * Fixed error text when using ~tell()~ with a bad Actor Address
    (previously identified the wrong call).

  * Ensure Actor System ~createActor()~ calls are not aborted
    prematurely by leftover responses to previous operations
    (e.g. timeout-unclaimed ~ask()~ responses).

*** 2.4.3 <2015-11-18 Wed>

  * Ensured that PoisonMessage sending doesn't recurse indefinitely.

  * Added a missing newline in status output formatting.

  * Added a descriptive failure output messaging for IP-based address
    connection failures.  This helps with common mistakes, such as
    specifying the "Admin Port" as a string instead of an integer.

  * Fixed a bug where calling ~ActorSystem().shutdown()~ multiple
    times would throw an exception.

  * Fixed a bug on multi-level import references (e.g. ~import x.y.z~)
    in sources loaded by ~loadActorSource()~ operations.

  * Fixed a bug where old actors checking in with a restarted
    ActorSystem caused exceptions.

  * Fixed a TCP transport bug that caused transmits to be abandoned
    instead of being retried after the back-off timer expired.

  * Updated default thespian.log logfile creation to honor ~$TMPDIR~ if
    it is set and only default to directing logging to ~/tmp~ if it is
    not set.

  * Added internal ~wait()~ call for logger child process on shutdown
    to avoid defunct loggers.

  * Removed a debug printf in the simpleSystemBase.

*** 2.4.2 <2015-10-26 Mon>

  * Delay thesplog location determination until usage to allow startup
    code to adjust location.

  * Better daemonization of multiproc Admin on Unix.

  * Ensure filenums to close is passed as a list not a Python3
    iterator when creating multiproc children (bugfix).

*** 2.4.1 <2015-10-20 Mon>

  * Updated to allow packets not blocked on waiting for an address
    resolution to be sent even if previous packets are still waiting
    for that resolution.

  * Fixed documentation uploads.

*** 2.4.0 <2015-10-18 Sun>

  * Add loadActorSource() and unloadActorSource() to Actor API
    (duplicating existing Actor System API functionality).

  * Internal: use distributed importlib whenever possible.

  * Fix stats response for Actor Systems for Python3.

  * Allow optional error strings in reporting actor creation failures.

  * Better capture and reporting of loaded source instantiation errors.

  * Miscellaneous test and logging updates.


** 2.3
*** 2.3.0 <2015-10-04 Sun>

  * Added ActorTypeDispatcher enhanced base class to facilitate
    dispatching of received messages based on message type.

  * Ensure exceptions occuring while writing to Thespian file log do
    not cause failures.

  * Protect against exceptions occurring when comparing messages for
    equality.

  * Updates to testActorSystemRestart.

  * Update "Thespian Generation" common Capabilities to version (2,3).
    Previous 2.2.0 release erroneously did not update this value.


** 2.2
*** 2.2.0 <2015-09-27 Sun>

  * Fix internal links in Using Thespian document.

  * Add support for multiple convention notification registrations.

  * Allow ActorSystem logDefs to be specified as False to suppress any
    logging configuration; especially useful for test log capture
    modes.

  * Better ActorSystem startup processing to distinguish between a
    re-specification of the current base and a new base, and added the
    transientUnique startup argument to get a plain instance (a
    non-global-singleton instance).

  * Added missing description of the ActorSystem ~shutdown()~
    operation in the Using Thespian document.

  * Added ability to set the maximum thesplog logging file via the
    ~THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE~ environment variable and changed the default
    to 50KB.

  * Added Using Thespian documentation description of logging with the
    ~THESPLOG_FILE~ and ~THESPLOG_FILE_MAXSIZE~ environment variable
    controls.


** 2.1
*** 2.1.6 <2015-09-27 Sun>

  * Fix imports in tests and actors.py for multiple Python versions.

  * Add missing timeout to test to prevent hang.

*** 2.1.5 <2015-09-20 Sun>

  * Adds support for Python 3.3 and Python 3.4 versions, including the
    use of the PyPy interpreter.

  * Adds the ~listen()~ API call (~ask()~ is ~tell()~ + ~listen()~)

  * Log Actor exception through normal logging channels as well as via
    Thespian internal logging output.

  * The Thespian shell loads the TestActor via loadable sources.

  * The simpleSystemBase will always apply default logging.

  * The ~loadActorSource()~ call can now take a file-like object as
    well as a filename.

  * Added the Thespian Developer's document.

  * Added the Thespian In-Depth Introduction document.

  * Added the Thespian Index (main pages) document.

  * Added the Thespian Releases document.

  * Internal updates to more gracefully handle shutdown scenarios and
    avoid impossible retransmits.

  * Testing, documentation, and setup file updates.


*** 2.1.4 Initial Public Release <2015-08-31 Mon>
